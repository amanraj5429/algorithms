'''
You are given a 0-indexed array of string words and two integers left and right.

A string is called a vowel string if it starts with a vowel character and ends with a vowel character where vowel characters are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'.

Return the number of vowel strings words[i] where i belongs to the inclusive range [left, right].
